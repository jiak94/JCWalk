Parallel divided the people of North Vietnam from those living in  
South Vietnam.  Thus, for the second time within a decade, the U. S.
was to become involved in defending the free citizens in the southern
half of a riven nation.       </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
are many obvious similarities manifest in the conflicts in both Korea
and Vietnam.  However, the manifold similarities between the war in
Korea and the very long war in Vietnam are consistent, even though
paradoxical.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
Korea, the war was fought in rugged mountain terrain where below zero
temperatures were common and frostbite was a painful reality.  In
Vietnam, the skirmishes were fought in humid and oppressively hot
rice paddies, steamy jungles and muddy rivers. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
Korea, the fight pitted opposing armies on the traditional fields of

scattered villages. They would then disappear into a labyrinth of
uncharted tunnels or retreat back into the jungles.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
Korea, planes, jeeps, tanks and armored troop carriers were utilized
fully and the role of the helicopter was minor.  In Vietnam
helicopters did the preponderance of the heavy lifting!   </FONT></FONT>

1950, the U. S. reacted immediately to repel aggression by North
Korea. In Vietnam, no American troops were deployed until the war had
raged for more than a decade.  Even then, it was only after the
French defeat at </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Dien

their subsequent withdrawal from French Indochina that the U. S.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
complexities of U. S. involvement in Vietnam are many!  And there are
significant political ramifications, half-truths, ill-considered
military decisions and other negatives that beg consideration when
pondering our nations’ political and military roles in that
conflict.  From being surprised by the Viet Cong Tet Offensive in
January of 1968, --- to the My Lai execution type slayings of
Vietnamese villagers some six weeks hence, --- and on to the killing
of anti-war students at Kent State University in May of 1970, the U.
S. made numerous and critical mistakes both at home and Vietnam in
the conduct of that most complex war.   </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However,
the initial U. S. involvement in Vietnam came in 1959 when </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>President

the South Vietnamese   following the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem,
the number of American advisors was steadily increased until August

incident permanently altered the United States strategy of minimal
involvement in Vietnam.  And, by 1969, the U. S. had deployed an
armed contingent of over 543,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and
Marines to fight a guerrilla force of some 35,000 men who were adept
at hit-and- run jungle warfare. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
was no stated purpose for the Vietnam War, a war that did not
suddenly erupt as had WW-II and Korea.  Vietnam simply evolved over a
span of years to become a war that would last for more than a decade.
 The Vietnam commitment was extremely unpopular with many Americans
and thousands of young men refused to be drafted. Many fled to Canada
and other nations to avoid service in the military or being sent to
prison.  Nonetheless, and despite riotous protests and other
manifestations of conflict over the war, millions of young Americans
disregarded the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Counter
Culture</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
movement of the 1960s and answered the call to serve.  Thus, our debt
of gratitude to those who put their lives on the line in Vietnam will
endure forever.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nearly
three and a half million Americans served in Southeast Asia during
the Vietnam era.  And, during those 13 years of involvement, a period
that includes an eight year span of active combat that began in 1965,
more than 58,000 Americans were killed.  Of that number, some 47,434
died while engaged in the many battles.  In addition, there were more
than 153,300 American service-members who were wounded.  And, due to
the effects of </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Agent
Orange, </B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>a
chemical used to defoliate enemy hiding places in the dense jungles,

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Listed
among the more painful casualties of the war were the Americans who
were imprisoned in the so-called Hanoi Hilton, one of the more brutal
prison camps in history.  And it was with joyous relief that millions
of Americans saw those POWs exit the planes that brought them to the
Philippines.  One can never forget the sudden release of pent-up
emotions when Admiral Jeremiah Denton, the first POW to step from the
first plane, tearfully saluted the flag and uttered the phrase, “God
Bless America?” </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A>      
      <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bravery and
valor were as common in Vietnam as had been those characteristics in
previous wars.  And among those cited for such gallantry is Georgia’s
own Maj. Gen. James E. Livingston, USMC (Ret.).  Gen. Livingston, as
a young captain and company commander earned the Medal of Honor for
his heroic leadership during the clash of forces at Dong Ha and Dai
Do, a bloody battle that was fought in April and May of 1968.  Gen.
Livingston, now living in S. C., was the featured speaker at the
founding of the Johns Creek Veterans Association.  His book, Noble
Warrior, is a must read for those interested in the history of the
Vietnam War. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Recognition
of the men and women who fought in Vietnam was a long time coming!

omission by signing a proclamation commemorating the 50</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Anniversary of the Vietnam War.  The commemoration will be kept
annually until November 11, 2025.  And during those 13 years, which
symbolize our 13 years in Vietnam, the nation will, on that date,
remember the patriotic Americans who served during that divisive time
in our nation’s history, a time when those in uniform were often
scorned and spat upon.  Thankfully, a reflective nation now attempts
to rectify that injustice!       </FONT></FONT>
