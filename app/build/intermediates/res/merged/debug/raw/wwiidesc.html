<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>1.
 The battles in western Sicily brought two predominantly Roman
Catholic armies into direct conflict for the first time ever.

Roman Catholic, was opposed by Italian forces that were almost
entirely of that religion.</FONT></FONT></P>

leaders needed to run the affairs of the conquered cities.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>3.
 Gen. Patton indulged his ornery legend during the campaign in Sicily
via the field hospital slapping incidents involving soldiers
suffering from battle fatigue. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>4.
 Gen. Patton also sated his fiery nature when he pulled out a pearl
handled pistol and shot a Sicilian farmers’ stubborn donkey that
was hindering his troops from crossing a bridge.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>5.
 Many Italian-American soldiers had relatives living on Sicily and
instead of fearing the invading American forces; large numbers of
Sicilians greeted them as friends or family. </FONT></FONT>

invasion in history followed a series of nighttime parachute drops

months following D-Day, the retreating Nazis’ launched a counter

Belgium. Some of the most intense fighting of WW-II occurred in those

the inevitable and following the forty day delay of Allied progress
