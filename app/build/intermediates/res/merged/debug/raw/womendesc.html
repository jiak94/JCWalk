<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Throughout
history women have gone to war and placed themselves in harms’ way
for various and multiple reasons. From the legendary feats of ancient
Amazon warriors to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and
progressing on to the wars of the future, women have served and will
serve beside their male counterparts wherever there are battles to be
fought.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Among
the most celebrated female combatants of history is the French born,
peasant heroine, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Joan
of Arc.</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Joan was born in 1412 and during the time when the so-called </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>100
Years War  </B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
raged between France and England.  And she was but 17 when King
Charles VII sent her to Orleans as the captain of a troop of men.
Joan guided her troop to victory during that battle in 1429 and it
was because of her actions at Orleans that she was immortalized in
the chronicles of world history.  Joan was subsequently captured,
tried for heresy and burned at the stake in the city of Rouen England
on May 30, 1431, --- when she was just 19. Then, a half millennium
following her execution, the Church reversed its position and made
her a saint in 1920.  No one is more symbolic of courageous women
than is Joan of Arc. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
contrast to Joan of Arc stands Florence Nightingale.  Nightingale,
who became a beloved symbol for her work in providing healing for
those wounded in battle, was born in 1820. Her affluent and socially
connected British parents were living in Florence Italy at the time
of her arrival. And despite her privileged childhood, she began
showing a strong sense of compassion for the poor and afflicted at a
very early age.  She would go on to defy her parents demand that she
wed someone of means and she refused a “suitable” proposal so
that she could devote her life to nursing.  Foremost among her many
endeavors were her achievements during the Crimean War in the 1850s.
Nightingale and her team of 34 nurses, upon arriving in the Turkish
city of Constantinople, started immediately to correct the filthy
conditions at a British base hospital. And, by purging the hospital
of the disease spawning grime, they swiftly reduced the death count
by an astonishing two-thirds among the wounded patients. Thus, in the
squalor of that wartime hospital, Florence Nightingale and her team
of nurses forever changed the unwholesome practices that had caused
so many avoidable deaths among battlefield survivors throughout the
ages. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Florence
Nightingale spent her nights making the rounds and giving personal
care to the wounded in that infirmary.  And she became known to those
who did not know her by name as the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>“LADY
with the Lamp.”  </B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Florence
Nightingale lived a life that was defined by restoring war torn human
beings and mending those who were hurt wherever she found them.  And
before her life was to reach the end of its earthly duration in the
year of 1910, when she was 90, this remarkable woman had dutifully
established the St. Thomas Hospital and the Nightingale Training
School for Nurses in the city of London.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
its inception the United States has been blessed with women who have
chosen to stand beside their men as they fought to defend our nation.
 During the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Revolutionary
War</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>,
a woman named Mary Ludwig Hays fought alongside her husband during
the 1778 battle at Monmouth. During that hot June day with
musket-balls saturating the air around her, Mary ran tirelessly among
the troops to deliver refreshing pitchers of water. And, for that
action, she became known as </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Molly
Pitcher.</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
It is said that her husband died from the heat or that he was killed
during those hours of fighting.  Molly then took over his job as
matross, someone who loads and fires cannons, and she continued
firing away at the Redcoats.  Another name that is listed as the
inspiration for the legend of Molly Pitcher is that of Margaret
Corbin.  Corbin, in much the same manner as Mary Hays, had delivered
pitchers of water and then manned a cannon gun following the death of
her husband during the battle of Ft. Washington in 1776.</FONT></FONT></P>

little known circumstance of the Revolutionary War was the role
played by black women who were slaves on the plantations.  Many of
those slave women acted as cooks and nurses for the wounded soldiers
and they took excellent care of the slave owners’ children when
wives would leave home for extended periods to visit their husbands.
However, among the more important contributions by those
African-American slave women was the information they would gather as
spies against the British Army. </FONT></FONT>

American women continued to serve as cooks and nurses for both
Confederate and Union soldiers during the Civil War.  And we must
never forget the inspirational influence of Harriet Tubman who served
as a Union spy, an unpaid soldier, a freedom fighter and a volunteer
nurse during that gory conflict between the states.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Women
continued to be involved in our nations’ wars, primarily as cooks,
nurses and care-givers up until WW-II when their roles were expanded
and they were allowed to put on the uniforms of the four military
branches. Women then took on the roles of chauffeurs, clerks and
other non-combat roles in all branches of the services.  And it was a
young WAC corporal, Helen Kogel-Denton, now deceased, who
single-handed typed the reams of orders for the D-Day Invasion that
was to be issued by General Eisenhower.  Helen Denton, originally
from South Dakota, went on to work for Delta Airlines as a secretary
in the maintenance department and for the many years preceding her
death, she lived in the suburbs south of Atlanta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">                <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following
WW-II, in 1948, President Truman signed a law that made women a
permanent part of the military services.  However, it was not until
1976 when a small group of women were admitted into a U. S. military
academy.  Since then the rolls of women in the five branches of the
military have been gradually expanded to where women are now involved
in every aspect of the U. S. military. However, it was not until 2013
that the Army issued an order to end the policy of “no women in
units that are tasked with direct combat.” </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">                 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
the Mollie Pitchers of the American Revolution and up until the
present day in contemporary America, women have played a vital role
and have performed brilliantly both as nurses and on the field of
battle.  From providing refreshing containers of water to the
soldiers in Gen. George Washington’s Army, women have broken
through the barriers and they now fly helicopters, fighter jets,
transport planes and bombers.  And, in the Coast Guard, they command
ships and vessels.  In recent years women have attained the lofty
ranks of admiral and general. At some point in time, a woman will
become either Chairman of the Joint Chiefs or be appointed Chief of
Staff for one or more of the services. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As of 2011 it was
reported that some 214,098 women were serving on active duty and that
they constituted 14.6% of the total active duty force.  An additional
72,290 females were numbered among the Reserve and Guard categories
and they represented 15.5% of the reserve forces.  The Air Force has
the highest percentage of women with 19.1% on active duty and 26.6%
in the reserves.  The Marine Corps fields the fewest women with only
6.8% of those who serve being on active duty and only 5.7% being in
the Marine Corps Reserve.   </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>
