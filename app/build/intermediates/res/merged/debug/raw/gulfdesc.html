<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Gulf War was instigated on August 2, 1990 when Iraqi forces, under
Saddam Hussein, invaded oil rich Kuwait, a small nation in the Middle
East that is bordered by the Persian Gulf.  On that same day the U.
N. passed a resolution denouncing the invasion and only four days
following that condemnation, on August 6, imposed sanctions on Iraq. 
On August 7, President George H. W. Bush commanded implementation of

the designation for the build-up of forces in Saudi Arabia and other
Gulf nations.  Desert Shield would last thru January 15, 1991.  And
then, on January 16, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Desert

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Despite
months of U. N. sanctions and the massing of troops and weapons in
Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield, Saddam could not be
persuaded to withdraw from Kuwait and to abandon his intent to
confiscate the oil resources of that small nation. And, since August
8, when he had defiantly annexed that small country, nothing could
persuade him to withdraw his army of occupation.  The presumed reason
for the takeover was to pay the huge debt that Iraq had acquired
during its disastrous eight year war with Iran, its powerful neighbor
to the east that Saddam had also invaded.  Thus, there were
geopolitical, oil revenue and territorial considerations that
prompted Saddam to defy the world order and to hold on tenaciously in
Kuwait.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Events
continued to unfold and on August 25, the U. N. passed a resolution
to allow enforcement of its embargo by military means if necessary. 
Iraq refused to budge and on November 29, 1990, the U. N. authorized
the use of force to remove the Iraqi forces if they were not
withdrawn by January 15, 1991.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With
no Iraqi reaction to the November ultimatum for Saddam to withdraw
from Kuwait,  it was only two days following the set deadline when,
on the morning of January 17</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th,</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
the fury of Operation Desert Storm was unleashed against the war
mongering Saddam Hussein. And, for the next five weeks, Iraqi targets
were pounded by naval and air bombardments against targets in Iraq
and Kuwait.           </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
on February 24</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>,
the U. N. coalition, under the command of U. S. General Norman
Schwarzkopf, launched the ground invasion to drive the Iraqi
regiments from Kuwait.  Saddam’s army was no match for the
predominantly American detachments and within one hundred hours
following the ground offensive, Baghdad radio suddenly announced that
Iraq would comply with the U. N. resolution to withdraw.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However,
before Saddam’s capitulation, air raid sirens had wailed throughout
Israel and thousands of Israelis were forced to flee to underground
covers to escape the incoming Scud missiles.  The first of those
missiles was intercepted and destroyed over Dhahran, Saudi Arabia by
an American Patriot missile.  However one such Scud was fired at an
American barracks in Dhahran. That lone Scud missile fulfilled its
mission and some 26 American soldiers lay dead following that attack.

though the Gulf War lasted for only eight and a half months from
August 2, 1990 until it was declared over on April 11, 1991, and U.
S. troops had participated in actual combat for only six weeks during
Operation Desert Storm, some 293 American service members were
returned home in coffins.  Some 148 had been killed in action and
another 145 deaths were caused by non-hostile actions.  And, an
addition 776 American troops were wounded.   It is also estimated
that Iraq lost up to 35,000 men killed with more than 75,000 wounded.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>U.
S. supplied more than 425,000 of that number.  However, despite the
size of that U. N. Force, the retreating Iraqi’s did not leave
quietly.  During their forced retreat from Kuwait, they created a
huge oil slick in the Persian Gulf and set fire to over 700 oil wells
in that small country, actions that did immense harm to the earths’
environment.   </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
estimated cost of the Gulf War amounted to some $61 billion with
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf States covering some $36 billion
of that total liability. </FONT></FONT>
