campaign that toppled Saddam Hussein from power.  The reasons for the
conflict are complicated and the final outcome will remain unknown
for decades. Nonetheless, it was believed by International
Intelligence sources, Military experts and most Elected officials
that the struggle would be over quickly.  Those, however, were
inaccurate assessments and the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>War
in Iraq </B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>became
expensive, deadly, strategically flawed and politically divisive. 
During those 8 years of conflict, some 4,491 American lives were lost
and more than 3,500 of those deaths were combat related.  And we must
add to that number of fatalities an additional 32,200 Americans who
were wounded.</FONT></FONT></P>

America’s outrage over the cruelty that was perpetrated by Islamic
terrorists on 9/11, 2001.  During that exploitation of evil more than
3,300 individuals succumbed to the flames that engulfed the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>World

of the deadly feats of 9/11 was the smashup of a hijacked passenger
plane near Shanksville Pennsylvania.  And, except for the courage
shown by heroic passengers aboard that flight, that plane would have
crashed into either the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>White

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Saddam’s
brazen nature and his bellicose utterances caused many on Capitol
Hill and among America’s allies to believe that he stood
responsible for 9/11.  And he was thought to own stockpiles of
</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>weapons
of mass destruction</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>,
armaments he had pledged to destroy following the first Gulf War in
the 1990s.  Saddam later reneged on his pledge to provide verifiable
proof that he had destroyed those arsenals.  And he defiantly
prohibited the U. N. sanctioned Inspectors of the opportunity to
conduct the agreed upon searches for such weapons.         </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even
though Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction were never to be located
either before, during or subsequent to the eight years of warfare,
Saddam’s truculent refusal to honor the terms imposed following
Iraq’s incursion into Kuwait caused Intelligence sources to believe
that he was at least partially responsible for 9/11.  And because of
those mistaken conclusions that linked Iraq’s violation of its
Kuwaiti neighbor some ten years prior with the terrorist assaults on
9/11, the U. S. and her allies went to war against Iraq in the early
weeks of 2003.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Via
the transparency of hindsight it seems that Saddam had nothing to do
with 9/11.  Thus, the War that stemmed from erroneous Intelligence
reckonings became a conflict that turned costly, deadly and divisive.
 The U. S. spent over a trillion dollars fighting the war in Iraq. 
However, of far greater consequence is the lives’ lost and the
debilitating injuries suffered by American service members.  And in
addition to the American casualties, it is estimated that more than a
million Iraqi soldiers and civilians were slain during that conflict.</FONT></FONT></P>

systems continued to evolve during the wars in </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Afghanistan
and Iraq. </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
in the many dusty villages of those ancient nations, American service

</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>(IED)</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
is a simple though deadly weapon that is easily improvised, assembled
and detonated by an individual who can be more than a mile away from
the buried explosive.  And the IED has become the preferred weapon of
opportunity in such conflicts.  It is a weapon that has inflicted
untold pain and suffering on the men and women who have died from or
have been mutilated by IEDs.  The IED is a deadly mixture of
explosives and shrapnel that is readily available to those who engage
in guerilla warfare.  And the IED is liable for many thousands of
lost American lives, limbs, eyes and a host of debilitating injuries.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
weapon used extensively in the Afghan Iraqi conflicts is the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>RPG
or the Rocket Propelled Grenade,</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
a potent antitank weapon.  The RPG is launched from a human shoulder
in much the same manner that the bazooka was used in WW-II and the
toll taken on tanks, trucks and soldiers engaged in combat is
devastating.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>spread
use in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Drones are employed to perform feats
that once required piloted planes to fly into deadly enemy fire over
certain targets.  The mission of the drone is to reduce the incidents
that place American lives in danger, and they will continue to be
improved technologically.  The life-saving role of the drone will be
expanded and the use of unmanned drones will become more and more
common in wars that are yet to be fought. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
reasons for the Iraqi War will never be totally understood and the
results can never be fully measured.  However even though the war did
achieve its purpose of toppling Saddam Hussein from power, he almost
certainly had nothing to do with 9/11.  Nonetheless, the events of
9/11 became the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>indirect

     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There are
striking similarities in the reasons for and the timelines that
define the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Thus, to avoid redundancy
in the narratives of those conflicts, this segment has delved
primarily into the happenings of 9/11.  And the series of provocative
events preceding the wars in those two nations is narrated at the
Afghan Plaza.  </FONT></FONT>
