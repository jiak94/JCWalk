million and millions of additional noncombatants are listed among the
20 million soldiers and civilians who were wounded.  In prior wars,
the majority of military deaths were from disease and not from the

battlefields when fearless pilots engaged in plane-versus-plane

to prowl the seas and wreak havoc on allied shipping. Those
submarines torpedoed some 6,596 allied vessels with a heavy loss of

use the technologically improved tank and the more sophisticated

released some 68,000 tons of the toxic substance with an addition
51,000 tons being discharged by Great Britain and France. Some 1.2
