the more horrific conditions to which any service member will ever be

or to go </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Missing

 From the decadence of the Civil War camps in Andersonville and

and on to the fetid conditions of the camps in Japan, Germany,
Russia, Korea, Vietnam and locations in the current areas of
conflict, the atrocious treatment of captured soldiers defies all
perceptions of human decency.  And the mortality rate among those
held captive is staggering. Thus, to be taken </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>POW</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
is oft times a fate that is worse than death.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>The
Bataan Death March</B></I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following
the fall of Corregidor during the early days of WW-II, --- the 72,000
U. S. and Philippine solders that were captured, many of them already
sick and starving, were sent on a sixty three mile march to where
they were to be held at Camp O’Donnell.  Many died during the five
day trek from a lack of food and water in addition to those that were
executed by the brutal Japanese guards.  Upon arrival at that
destination, --- it was discovered that some 7,000 to 10,000 of those
subdued soldiers had died while in-route.  The POWs were given no
food and little or no water during the March of Death.  And even
though there were artesian wells flowing with the life sustaining
liquid scattered along the way, the Japanese guards would shoot
anyone caught attempting to snitch a drink.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many
who survived the hike were sent to prison camps in Japan where the
treatment was merciless. And, from among the 140,000 POWS held in
those camps, one of every three died from starvation, the horrendous
work-load, disease or the corporal punishment doled-out by the
guards.  The feudal mind-set of the Japanese dictated that they fight
until death and they looked with contempt upon anyone who showed the
immoral weakness to surrender.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
contrast to the Japanese, the American custom was to treat POWs in a
humane manner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Therefore,
U. S. held prisoners were never tortured or starved and their medical
needs received attention.  Both the Germans and the Soviets rivaled
the Japanese in the viciousness with which they treated those who
were captured.  Even so, no depth of depravity can ever match or
surpass the evil treatment that became the lot of the unfortunate
wretches who were rounded up and murdered by the millions in the
concentration camps of the Nazis.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Germany
is estimated to have taken from 4.0 to 5.7 million Russian POWs.  And
it is reckoned that some 2.7 to 3.3 million of those Soviet soldiers
died while in German custody.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Those
calculations reflect a death rate among the Soviet captives of an
astounding 68%.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
number of Germans captured by the USSR is thought to be over 3.1
million. And the deaths among those Russian held Nazi soldiers are
estimated to range from 475,000 to nearly 1.01 million. However, the
whereabouts of 1.3 million German soldiers remain unknown.</FONT></FONT></P>

POWs were again subjected to sadistic brutality in Korea and the fate
of thousands of those American service members is still unknown. 
Most of those missing are no doubt dead.  But, many among them could
have suffered the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>still
unknown fate</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
of those who were confirmed to be Missing in Action. --- Needless to
say, the brutality in the North Korean prison camps rivaled that of
the Japanese during WW-II, --- in every probable way!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During
Vietnam a satanic ritual of cruelty again became the order of the day
for captive Americans!  Men like former Navy pilots McCain, Denton,
Stockdale, Mulligan and Alvarez were to become the symbolic faces of
those who endured the hellish torture at North Vietnam’s so-called
Hanoi Hilton.  And, even lesser known detainees were subjected to the
same measures of incredible cruelty.  Because of their years of
torture in the prison camps of Vietnam, everyone grasped the depth of
feeling when Admiral Jeremiah Denton stepped from the plane returning
the POWs to the Philippines, and then salute the flag and utter the
phrase, “God Bless America.” With those three simple words an
emotional Admiral Denton communicated his pride in what it means to
be an American!  And with that straightforward and guileless
utterance, --- the admiral brought forth tears of joy to millions of
his fellow Americans.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With
the dawning of the 21</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Century a war-weary world shifted into a new era of warfare, an era
during which there will be stunning advances in technology and
weaponry. However, the fanatical enemies we now oppose have the same
cruel mindset that has caused so much pain and suffering among those
held prisoner throughout history. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ours
is a radical enemy that will look with disdain on those captured. 
And, from North Africa to the Middle East and perhaps even within the
U. S., we confront a radical enemy that will slit the throats and
sever the heads of any with whom they disagree, even non-combatant
women and innocent children. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thus,
as veterans of past conflicts, it is our hope that none who serve
will ever know the horror of being taken prisoner or listed among the
missing.  And we pray that an almighty Providence will have mercy on
any who might be taken during our nations’ hi-tech battles of the
future.  Advanced weaponry has diminished the risk of being captured
but it has in no way diminished the horrific treatment that will be
accorded those taken prisoner in the new century.</FONT></FONT></P>
