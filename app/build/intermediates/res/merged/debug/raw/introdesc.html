<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
the winter of (1777-78) when the ill-clothed men of <I><B>Gen. George
Washington&rsquo;s</B></I> <I><B>Continental Army</B></I> endured
freezing temperatures and an excess of associated miseries, while
encamped at Valley Forge<I><B>,</B></I> brave men and women have
answered to the call to help. The resolute patriots who birthed our
nation and ensuing generations of men and women have repeatedly
placed themselves in harms&rsquo; way to uphold our concept of
Freedom<I><B>. </B></I><B> </B>Those individuals have suffered death<B>,</B>
torture<B>, </B>severed limbs<B>,</B> burned bodies<B>,</B> broken
bones and lengthy separations&rsquo; from loved ones to attend the
greater cause of our nation. More recently, post-traumatic stress
disorder, <I><B>PTSD</B></I>, formerly known as shell shock or battle
fatigue<I><B> </B></I>has taken an emotional toll on many who
survived the battlefield experience of land mines, hand grenades and
bullets. Those horrendous costs were incurred to preserve our rights
to <I><B>Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness!</B></I> It is to
this heritage that the Johns Creek Veterans Memorial Walk is
dedicated<B>.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

respective flagstaffs.  As those proud emblems unfurl to the
prevailing breeze, one cannot but recognize that they symbolize the
men and women who have served and continue to serve our nation so
very well. Whether one is native born or naturalized as an American
citizen, our traditions of   equality and justice were bought and the
debt paid by those who fought and died under those<B> </B>five
service ensigns<B>.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

that hymn were written by <I><B>Frances Scott Key </B></I>during<I><B>

morning of September 14, 1814,<B> </B>the second year in that long

pennant then became the inspiration for the stanzas that were to
become our national anthem. </FONT></FONT>

</B></I>From the musketeers of Washington&rsquo;s era until now,
women have stood beside their armed men to shoulder the burdens of
warfare as nurses and coequal members of the armed services. And
today, brave women fly jet fighter planes and command ships.  In
addition, they take on the mundane and exhaustive tasks of any and
all who wear the uniforms. <B> </B>The women of America have done
themselves and our nation an extensive array of the military jobs for
which they and we can all be quite proud<B>!</B>  <B> </B>  </FONT></FONT>
