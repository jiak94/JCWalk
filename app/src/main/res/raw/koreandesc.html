Korean War began during the pre-dawn hours of June 25, 1950, and was
the first of several conflicts that would define the Cold War era. 
The hostilities were initiated when 75,000 North Korean soldiers
poured over the 38</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
parallel to invade neighboring South Korea. Their objective was to
overpower the ill prepared South Korean Army and then to establish a
repressive communist form of government on their neighbors to the
south.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
conflict would rage until the morning of July 27, 1953 when delegates
from the opposing sides met to sign the cease fire agreement.  Even
though combat was ended on that day, the armistice was tenuous and
the war was not declared over until the last day of January 1955. 
President Harry Truman never asked Congress to pass a formal
declaration of war and even though more than 54,000 American died in
defense of South Korea, the hostilities were never designated as
anything more than a </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>police
action.</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
 Thus, the War in Korea never officially began and it never
officially ended. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">           <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>More
than 33,600 of the 54,000 deaths were inflicted on the field of
battle. Those brave Americans died in defense of the South Korean
people and to thwart the spread of communism.  Another 103,000
American service members were wounded with more than 3,700 captured,
starved and tortured. Of the 8,196 who were taken prisoner  or
declared missing, the whereabouts of over 7,000 remain un-known some
six decades following the ceasefire agreement, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>a

and that label reflects our failure to recognize those who partook in
that crusade of the 1950s. Even though the Korean campaign was never
declared a war, those bloody clashes produced more than 169,000 U. S.
casualties.    </FONT></FONT>

Americans never knew or have forgotten the staggering costs that are
evident in the number of lives and limbs that were sacrificed by
young Americans in the frigid mountains of Korea.  However, the
grateful people of South Korea have not forgotten.  The Republic of
Korea has generously sponsored the Korean War plaza where you now
stand.  And this plaza is but a token of that nation’s appreciation
to the American service personnel who sacrificed so much in defense
of that once fledgling democratic republic.</FONT></FONT></P>

the South Korean capital fell on the fourth night following the

Americans did not engage the invaders until July 5</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
and during that first encounter, the American units fought below
expectations. The assault continued and   the battered U. S. and
South Korean forces adopted a delaying strategy as they began their
retreat towards the port city of Pusan. There, a few miles outside
the city, they formed a defensive ring around Koreas’ second
largest metropolis, a ring that became known as the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Pusan

July 27, a dour faced Gen. Douglas MacArthur visited his top ground
commander, Gen. Walton Walker at his field headquarters outside
Pusan. The supreme commander was there to assess conditions inside
the so-called </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Pusan
Perimeter</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>,
the one small area in all of South Korea that had not fallen to the
communists. MacArthur was said to have told Gen. Walker, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>“There
will be no Dunkirk in this command.  To retire to Pusan would be
unacceptable.”</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
 MacArthur was determined to hold the invaders outside the defensive
perimeter, the shielding ring that protected the vital port
facilities at Pusan.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Gen.

Koreans threw everything they could muster at the American and South
Korean forces.  The opposing armies fought to a virtual stalemate
before Gen. MacArthur, in perhaps the most intuitive strategy of his
brilliant career used U. S. Marines to launch an amphibious assault
at Inchon, some two hundred miles to the north of Pusan and on the
opposite coast of South Korea. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
raid on Inchon caused the North Korean command to realize that
MacArthur had implemented an action to cut their supply lines from
the north.  They understood that they were being trapped and in
danger of being annihilated by Gen. Walkers 8</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Army as it raced north from Pusan, and the Marine Divisions moving
quickly to the south and east following the landings at Inchon. The
sobering reality of MacArthur’s strategy sent the invaders fleeing
back towards the 38</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Parallel with the 8</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Army in hot pursuit. However, Gen. Walker was not allowed to chase
the fleeing communists into North Korea. Then, near the end of
September, Gen. MacArthur was given the nod to cross the 38</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
Parallel. The chase was resumed and ended some weeks later at the
Yalu River, the boundary between China and North Korea.         </FONT></FONT>

Reservoir, a battle that erupted during late November and early
December of 1950. United Nations forces had driven right up to but
had stopped on the Korean side of the frozen river boundary. Thus,
some five months following the invasion of South Korea the North
Koreans were demoralized and defeated.  Overwhelming numbers of
Chinese soldiers then crossed the icy boundary to join the war on the
side of their communist puppets in North Korea. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">          <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
detachment of Marines was holding the Chosin Reservoir which was only
a few miles inland from the border along the Yalu but the Chinese
were determined to seize that electric power producing facility. The
outnumbered Marines fought courageously against the onslaught in
temperatures that reached minus 54 degrees Fahrenheit. Nonetheless
their numbers were inadequate to hold the big reservoir and they
began a grueling retreat to the coast.  There, they would board U. S.
transport ships to be evacuated and saved to fight another day. One
Marine who survived the Battle of the Chosin designed a bumper
sticker that read: --- </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>“Once
