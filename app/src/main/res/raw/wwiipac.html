bombs fell from the skies over the Hawaiian island of Oahu to

that balmy Sunday in the Islands, over 3,500 casualties were recorded
with dozens of civilians among the dead and wounded.  The Navy lost a
total of eighteen ships and the armed services lost a mixed bag of
263 warplanes. Of the eight battleships in port, four were sunk,
three damaged, and one grounded.  Even though six of those ships
would be returned to engage in combat, they were out of action for
some critical months as the war raged across the oceans and onto the
far flung islands of the South Seas.  In addition to the huge battle
wagons, three combat ready light cruisers and an equal number of
vital destroyers were lost to the Pacific Command.</FONT></FONT></P>

Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.  Congress then
voted unanimously to go to war against those Axis nations that were

events materialized on that long ago Sunday morning at Pearl Harbor. 
The turbulent seas that kept the carriers out of port and the
Japanese failure to destroy the fuel tanks and dry docks, facilities

historic raid on Japan.  For the first time ever, sixteen land-based
B-25 Mitchell bombers were dispatched from the deck of an aircraft

the noteworthy battles in the Pacific Theater was the naval Battle at
Midway, an action that ensued during the first week in June 1942. 
The crucial victory at Midway changed the direction of the war in
favor of the United States.  Ironically, the battle in the waters off
that desolate island of such strategic value pitted three of the U.

but when the smoke finally dissipated on June 7, some six months
following Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces had lost four aircraft
carriers, a heavy cruiser and scores of fighter planes. In contrast,
U. S. losses at Midway consisted of one aircraft carrier, the USS
Yorktown, a destroyer and a much smaller number of carrier based war
planes.  </FONT></FONT>
