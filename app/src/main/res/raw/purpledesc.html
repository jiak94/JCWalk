is a fascinating history behind the medal that is named the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Purple
Heart</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>.
 Since April 5, 1917, the medal has been awarded in the name of the
President of the United States to those wounded or killed while
serving with the U. S. military.  The Purple Heart differs though
from all other service awards in that it requires no recommendation
from anyone.  It is a </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>medal
of entitlement</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
that is awarded to those who meet a qualifying list of specific
criteria.  Among the criteria is that the Purple Heart is bestowed
for </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>“Being
wounded or killed in any action against an enemy of the United States
or as a result of an act of any such enemy or opposing armed forces.”</B></I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">               <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Purple Heart design experienced several makeovers leading up to its
current configuration which was adopted in the 1930s.  And the first
recipient was none other than Gen. Douglas MacArthur who received the
award on February 22, 1932, a date that intentionally coincided with
the birth-date of Gen. George Washington who had personally bestowed
the original </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Badge

medals on three </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Revolutionary
War</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
soldiers. And from the original Badge of Military Merit awards that
were bestowed on that trio of soldiers evolved the current day
version of the Purple Heart. In further tribute to our nations’
founding father, an obverse profile of Gen. George Washington defines
the medal received by Gen. MacArthur and all Purple Heart medals that
have been bequeathed since 1932.  </FONT></FONT>

of the Purple Heart</B></I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
history of the Purple Heart is a bit convoluted but it essentially
sprang from the Badge of Military Merit that was awarded to those
first three recipients by Gen. Washington in August 1782.  Thus, the
Purple Heart is the longest tenured medal in the pantheon of military
service awards that are bestowed by the United States.  No one
desires or seeks to receive a Purple Heart but it is among the most
widely distributed U. S. Military medals.  Exact numbers are unknown
but it is estimated that more than (1.9) million service members have
received the Purple Heart, the medal that reflects our nations
gratitude to those brave men and women who became casualties on the
field of battle. </FONT></FONT>

the Badge of Military Merit was the ---- </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Fidelity
Medallion or “Andre Capture Medal.”</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
--- That medal was awarded to Privates John Paulding, David Williams
and Isaac Van Wort, all of the New York State Militia.  Those three
privates were credited with the capture of Major John Andre, a
British army officer who was hanged as a spy during the American
Revolutionary War. ----- Andre was responsible for meeting with the
traitor, Benedict Arnold, on September 23, 1780 and persuading Arnold
to surrender the fort at West Point.  As an award for the trio of
heroic privates, each was given a $200 yearly pension and a silver
medal, the Fidelity Medallion.  All were later honored by having
counties in Ohio named for them. Also of interest is that Georgia’s
own Paulding County was named in recognition of Private John
Paulding.</FONT></FONT></P>
