war in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001, --- less than a month
following the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Osama

funded attacks against U. S. targets on </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>9/11</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>.
 However, the initial phase of American involvement in Afghanistan
began all the way back in 1980.  At that time a coalition of nations,
that included the U. S., provided arms and money to the Afghan

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second phase of U. S. engagement began in 1998 and it followed the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>al

on </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>U.

August of that year.  Those strikes were responsible for the deaths
of hundreds of nationals from those African nations in addition to a
number of Americans posted at the U. S. embassies in those two
countries.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following
those incidents, missiles were launched against Osama bin Laden at
his hideaways in the mountains of Afghanistan.  Those isolated
outposts had been provided as a safe refuge for Osama and his
al-Qaeda fanatics by the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Taliban
government in Kabul</B></I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>.
 Even though he was not widely known in August 1998, bin Laden was
well on the way to establishing his degenerate reputation with the
successful bombings of those U. S. Embassies.   </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Events
preceding the Afghan-War are fraught with reams of bewildering
evidence that is inconclusive and contradictory.  Thus, the surplus
of difficulties involved in the events leading to the war in
Afghanistan is difficult to investigate.  Even so, it seems the
embassy bombings were Osama’s opening salvo in his war against the
U. S., an extremist war that would culminate with the al-Qaeda
initiated horror of September 11.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Therefore,
the events of 9/11and the Taliban’s earlier refusal to deliver
Osama bin Laden </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>following
the embassy bombings in1998, became the logically valid reasons for
the U. S. to launch its bombing campaign in Afghanistan following the
horrors of 9/11.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">            <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Shadowing

then fought their way into Kabul.  Following the taking of that city
by the Northern Alliance, some 1,300 U. S. troops and advisors were
dispatched hurriedly to serve in Afghanistan.  And from that minimal
contingent of manpower in the final months of 2001, U. S. forces were
gradually increased to a peak of 100,000 by the year 2010.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>American
involvement in Afghanistan was in direct response to the Taliban’s
refusal to take custody of Osama bin Laden following his forays
against the U. S. embassies in 1998, and the murderous el Qaeda
rampage enacted against American targets on September 11, 2001.  And
even though he was not seemingly attached to any additional terrorist
incidents preceding 9/11, it is a fact that for more than two decades
radical Muslim extremists had taunted and goaded the United States.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first in the long series of provocations was in November 1979 when
Iranian students seized 60 United States citizens and held them
hostage.  Then, in October of 1983, a truck-bomb was detonated at a
Marine barracks in Lebanon, an act that massacred some 18 American
sailors,  220 U. S. Marines and 60 French soldiers who were sent by
the U. N.to keep the peace in that strife-torn nation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following
Lebanon was the terrorist massacre of 270 innocent people aboard
PanAm Flight-103 when it was blown from the skies over Lockerbie
Scotland in December of 1988.                                        
         </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
next provocation was the first attempt to topple the World Trade
Center in 1993.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
even though that first plot against a target on American soil failed
to accomplish its mission, </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
determined terrorists did not give up and they would be successful in
dismantling the twin towers when they came to call again in 2001.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following
that first attempt against the World Trade Center in 1993 was the
carnage wrought some five years later by the African embassy
explosions in 1998.                       </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
embassy violations were followed in the year 2000 by even an
additional feat of goading the U. S. when fanatical terrorists
attempted to sink the USS Cole as it refueled in the Yemeni port of
Aden. That incident inflicted death or injury on more than a score of
American sailors, --- and it came very close to sinking the U. S.
Destroyer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally,
there came the incidents of September 11, 2001. Osama bin Laden and
his al-Qaeda terrorists financed, plotted and recruited the 19
religious zealots who carried out the deadly attacks against targets
in New York City and Washington D. C. on that mild September morning.</FONT></FONT></P>

</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
U. S. resorted to war as a means to stop the terrorist attacks and to
dislodge al-Qaeda from its refuge in the Afghan mountains. However,
the outcome of that involvement will remain unknown for many years. 
In the meantime some 2,215 brave American men and women have already
died in Afghanistan --- with more than 1,830 of those deaths
occurring while engaged in battle. And, an additional 20,000 plus U.
S. service members have been wounded.   </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Those
steadfast American troops have endured IED explosions, sniper fire,
RPG attacks and deadly ambushes.  And some have been murdered by
so-called friendly Afghan saboteurs.  Nonetheless, they have fought
with valor and have upheld the honorable traditions of our United
States of America.  And, from among that cadre of America’s finest,
none is more representative of the gallantry shown in Afghanistan
than was professional football player Pat Tillman of the Arizona
Cardinals. Tillman spurned a lucrative career, in which he would have
been paid millions of dollars, to voluntarily place himself in harms’
way in Afghanistan, a decision that would cost him his life.  Pat
Tillman and his fallen comrades were proud to be Americans!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">              <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Americans
can also take great pride in the accomplishments of the Navy Seals, a
previously little known force of physically-honed and well-trained
sailors that has risen to prominence for their incredible
accomplishments in Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. And, it was heroic
Navy Seals who put an end to the evil ways of Osama bin Laden.  </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">               <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
are also residual benefits derived from the war in Afghanistan. 
Because of U. S. involvement in Afghanistan, it has been possible to
reverse several human-rights violations imposed by the Taliban. Among
the privileges to be restored following the defeat of the Taliban was
the just and moral right of Afghani girls and women to attend school
and be educated.    </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">             <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
residual benefit of the Afghan War was the previously mentioned
capture and killing of Osama bin Laden following his fleeing from
Afghanistan to another safe-haven in neighboring Pakistan.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A>      
     <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Due to similar
time lines, conditions and events defining the conflicts in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the Iraqi narrative includes commentary on 9/11with
little mention of the provocations preceding that day.  Thus, the
narrative on Afghanistan covers the provocations prior to 9/11with
but only brief references to that terrible day in American history. 
This was done to avoid repeating the same stories at the two
different plazas.   </FONT></FONT>
